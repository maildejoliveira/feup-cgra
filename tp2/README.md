## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 1 we learned how to optimize our code, by using the scene stack to our advantage by using the matriz transformations only once for different objects. Furthermore, we only used the class MyTriangle thus we had to use scaling transformations to create the Small/Big Triangles. 
We noticed that scaling can be a lot harder to implement than the other transformations and requires more practise.

- In exercise 2 we applied the main concepts learned previously in class. Howerver these concepts were used to build solids instead of plane objects.

- In exercise 3 we had no difficulties, since it was similar to the other exercises.
