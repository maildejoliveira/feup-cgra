## TP 5 Notes

- In exercise 1 we started to learn about the coords vector and how to manage it.
- In exercise 2 the main difficulty was to understand taht the offset was going to be in the x axis.
- In exercise 3 there were no difficulties because it was really similar to the "Sepia" shader.
- In exercise 4 we were not understanding how to print the texture in the repeated mode, instead of clamp to edge.
