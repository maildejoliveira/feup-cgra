## TP 4 Notes

- In exercise 1 the biggest struggle we had was to define different texCoords for the same class MyTriangle, we ended up by passing the array as a parameter in the constructor.  
- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in creating the GUI checkbox for the texture filtering, since when applied the only way to change the filter would be to call the  texParameteri function with a different filter option.
